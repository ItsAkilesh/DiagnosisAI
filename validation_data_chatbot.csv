right side of neck swollen and both sides of face in front of both ears are swollen as well i was told it might be my salivary gland do you think i could have mumps,it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken languageas you said that his speech is hard to understand preoccupation with stereotyped interestas in going to bathroom on the porch the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speechbefore he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology hope this helps take care,"['neck' 'swollen' 'infertility' 'infection' 'symptoms' 'swelling' 'glands'

is it common to have spasms with a splenic cyst and be unable to keep food down,radioactive iodine rai is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells   the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms,"['spleen' 'symptoms' 'food' 'spleen symptoms' 'best health'

to whom it may concern my son is 3 months old and he is on breastfeeding in his blood analysis which was done in 30 january 2017 number of neutrophils was 0 7nl after that we repeated blood test on 7 march 2017 and number of neutrophils was 1 27nl because of that result we did test again in 14 march 2017 and number was 0 9<negative_smiley>nl no other symptoms are revealed however according to pediatrician we did following tests iga igm igg hiv b12 and copper in blood currently we have only hiv result and it is negative please tell me is it possible in infants to have low number of neutrophils without any obvious reason and can it increase without any additional treatment and in what period of time thank you in advance,the most common form of neutropenia in infants and young children is transient neutropenia with or following a viral illness it resolves itself within 2 weeks if it lasts longer than that or the child is very ill then a full workup for neutropenia would be recommended in infants aged 2 weeks to 1 year the lower limit of the normal neutrophil count is 1000l after the first year of life the lower limit is 1500l as in adults spontaneous recovery in such cases occurs by age 5 years and the mean duration of neutropenia is approximately 20 months the clinical severity and frequency of infections rather than the severity of neutropenia would be used to determine the further management of the condition hence you should continue to work with the treating doctors for appropriate medical advice i hope this helps,['blood disorders'],1.0
i was depressed in 2008 until i hear voices after a year and was diagnose with psycosis i have been hearing voices for years but as years passes by i am becoming more confused if this was schizophrenia or is it clairvoyance or a combination how can i identify and train myself to handle these voices,it is difficult for a common person to deal with psychiatric issues on their own if you think you are having psychosis or related issues seek proper counselling with a psychiatrist who can prescribe you proper medications which can help you get better and function as a normal individual i hope this helps,['schizophrenia'],1.0

i had a pretty bad case of appendicitis almost 2 years ago i had no fever or nausea i was eating fine my white blood cell count was normal and the pain was dull at first about 3 4 weeks later the pain became intense if i laid on my stomach stretching my abdomen it was about a 7 8 on the pain scale i had emergency appendectomy after an ultrasound showed an inflamed appendix the surgeon told me it had not ruptured but was very infected and my body had walled off the infection and in 40 years i was his second case of a similar situation this was a pretty dramatic operation 4 nights in the hospital an infiltrated vein and 6 months of c diff after about 2 weeks ago i started noticing a similar pain lower right side near mcburney is point it is a warm throbbing sensation maybe 3 4 on the pain scale at its worse does this sound like possible stump appendicitis i am very worried as i have no current insurance and my first operation cost almost 40k including c diff treatment,this can be related to postoperative adhesion formation bed rest fluids pain medications e g nsaids spasmolytics etc will cool off a moderate case however if it recurs and persists with signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction then surgical lysis of the adhesion may be required its unlikely to a remains of the sort you pointed too if the appendectomy was conducted successfully wishing you best of health thanks,['appendix and appendicitis'],1.0
